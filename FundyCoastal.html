              In this full day session we will be introducing paddlers, already comfortable in their boats, 
              to the pleasures of the exposed coastline of the Bay of Fundy.
            </p>
            <p class="normal_para">
              The coastline from the scenic village of St Martins runs northeast, past sea caves, rocky outcroppings and sea stacks
              towards Melvin's Beach and on toward Little Salmon River. This is coastal exploration at its best.
            </p>
            <p class="normal_para">
              We'll have a chance to explore the environment and learn how to pick effective routes,
              how to deal with the Bay's legendary tides, and how to safely launch and land in potentially challenging conditions.
              We'll talk about trip planning, route selection, and navigation.
            </p>

              This session is open to anyone who is comfortable in a sea kayak and is ready to safely push their limits.
              A Paddle Canada Level 1 or equivalent experience would be desirable. Participants will have to be physically
              prepared for a full day on the water.  
            </p>

            <p class="normal_para">
              The Bay of Fundy is cold.  Its not much colder in May than it is at any other time of year, but that's because
              at any other time of the year its still really really cold! There will be no planned immersions in this session, but all
              participants must have cold water gear.  Drysuits are preferred.  We strongly recommend bringing extra clothing in
              a drybag - we'll be stopping for breaks en route. Anyone who wants to get in and play around the rocks will need a helmet.
            </p>

            <h2 class="centered">Expected Outcomes</h2>
            <p class="normal_para">
              At the session's end we will have had a chance to explore and enjoy a picturesque Maritime seascape.  We'll
              have planned and executed a day's excursion with colleagues and mentors and increased our comfort in (to some)
              unfamiliar waters. We'll have learned a few techniques for navigation in potentially foggy conditions.
            </p>
              <p class="normal_para">
              We will have learned something with new colleagues while having a lot of fun.
