      Dave has been paddling since he was 8. When he was in high school in Washington D.C., he began training with
      the U.S. National Team in whitewater slalom kayaking, and earned a spot on the team in 1990. In winter
      months, he often drove to school with a helmet on, because it was frozen to his head.

      By the time he was 19,
      he was the Head Instructor at the Madawaska Kanu Centre in Ontario. In 2001 he founded East Coast Outfitters-
      a paddling outfitter and school near Halifax, Nova Scotia. Dave is a Paddle Canada Instructor Trainer in sea
      kayaking, whitewater canoeing, and stand up paddle-boarding. He is a Master Learning Facilitator in
      Whitewater Kayaking with Canoe Kayak Canada.

    <p>His favourite boat is a dugout canoe that is sitting on a
      beach somewhere in Panama. At least thatâ€™s where he left it
