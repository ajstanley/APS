    <p>
      Tim White started paddling canoes in Boy Scouts by the age of 10, discovered sea kayaking at 22 and stand-up
      paddleboarding at 36. He has led expeditions and taught sea kayakers in Atlantic Canada, BC and Mexico since 1995.
      Ask him about paddling with alligators - it's the only thing on the water that has ever made him think twice.
